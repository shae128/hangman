# Hangman
This is a Hangman game simulation for the terminal, written in python language. I wrote this game to improve my python skills; Therefore, I didn't use any drawing or graphical library to make it more challenge. Your collaboration on making the code better and more efficient is highly appreciated.

After running the game, the player will be prompted to choose between playing mode:

1-Player( against the computer ) 

2-Players mode 

There is a file named **words.txt** which contains top 100 most common English names. This file is used as the reference for application to pick up random words for 1-player mode. If you want, you can replace it with your word selection; there are just two roles:

1. The file name has to remain words.txt
2. Every word should be in a newline

*If you don't respect any of the above roles, you'll have to edit the code also.*
